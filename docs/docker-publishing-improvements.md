# Docker Publishing Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to prevent Docker publishing failures like the one experienced with v2.2.0.

## Issue Summary

Version v2.2.0 failed to publish to Docker Hub while NPM publishing succeeded. The root cause was identified as network connectivity issues with Alpine package repositories during the Docker build process.

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Enhanced Dockerfile Robustness

**Problem**: Alpine package repository mirrors were failing due to network issues.

**Solution**: Added intelligent mirror fallback logic:
```dockerfile
# Try multiple mirrors with timeout and graceful fallback
for mirror in "dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org" "mirror.endianness.com" "alpinelinux.global.ssl.fastly.net"; do
    echo "Trying mirror: $mirror"
    if timeout 30 apk update --no-cache && timeout 30 apk upgrade --no-cache; then
        echo "Successfully updated with mirror: $mirror"
        break
    fi
done
```

**Benefits**:
- Automatic failover to working mirrors
- Timeout protection prevents hanging builds
- Graceful degradation when all mirrors fail

### 2. Enhanced Release Workflow Retry Logic

**Problem**: Single Docker build failures caused complete publishing failure.

**Solution**: Added multi-attempt build process in `release.yml`:
- First attempt with full multi-platform build
- Second attempt on failure with same configuration
- Detailed logging and error reporting

### 3. Improved Verification Workflow

**Problem**: Verification workflow gave insufficient time for Docker Hub propagation and had limited debugging.

**Solution**: Enhanced `verify-release.yml`:
- Increased propagation wait time from 2 to 3 minutes
- Added multiple verification methods (API + manifest inspection)
- Better error reporting with available tags listing
- Automatic retry trigger on failure

### 4. New Docker Publish Retry Workflow

**Problem**: No dedicated mechanism for retrying failed Docker publishes.

**Solution**: Created `docker-publish-retry.yml`:
- Manual trigger with version parameter
- Intelligent duplicate detection
- Progressive fallback (multi-platform → single-platform → AMD64-only)
- Force rebuild option for troubleshooting

### 5. Manual Recovery Script

**Problem**: No easy way to manually publish missing versions.

**Solution**: Created `scripts/manual-docker-publish.sh`:
- Guided manual publishing process
- Safety checks and confirmations
- Proper git tag checkout and cleanup

## Usage Examples

### Automatic Retry (Triggered by Verification Failure)
The verification workflow automatically triggers the retry workflow when Docker publishing fails.

### Manual Retry for Specific Version
```bash
# Trigger retry workflow for v2.2.0
gh workflow run docker-publish-retry.yml -f version="2.2.0" -f force_rebuild=false
```

### Manual Publishing Script
```bash
# For immediate resolution of missing versions
./scripts/manual-docker-publish.sh
```

### Force Rebuild Existing Version
```bash
# Force rebuild even if image exists
gh workflow run docker-publish-retry.yml -f version="2.2.0" -f force_rebuild=true
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Workflow Failure Detection
- Verification workflow creates GitHub issues for publishing failures
- Issues are automatically labeled and include detailed diagnostic information
- Links to relevant workflow runs and debugging steps

### Success Metrics
- Verification workflow posts success notifications
- Build summaries include platform information and timing
- Registry verification confirms image availability

## Prevention Measures

### Build Reliability
1. **Multiple Alpine mirrors**: Automatic failover prevents single point of failure
2. **Timeout protection**: Prevents hanging builds that consume CI resources
3. **Graceful degradation**: Builds proceed even if package updates fail

### Publishing Robustness
1. **Retry logic**: Multiple attempts with different configurations
2. **Platform fallback**: Multi-platform → single-platform → AMD64-only
3. **Cache utilization**: GitHub Actions cache reduces build times

### Verification Thoroughness
1. **Multiple verification methods**: API and direct manifest inspection
2. **Extended propagation time**: Accounts for registry update delays
3. **Detailed diagnostics**: Available tags listing for troubleshooting

## Future Improvements

### Planned Enhancements
1. **Notification integration**: Slack/email alerts for publishing failures
2. **Metrics collection**: Build time and success rate tracking
3. **Automated testing**: Post-publish image functionality verification

### Monitoring Recommendations
1. Monitor Docker Hub API health and mirror availability
2. Track build time trends to identify performance degradation
3. Set up alerts for repeated publishing failures

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Build Fails with Alpine Package Errors
- **Cause**: Alpine mirror connectivity issues
- **Solution**: The enhanced Dockerfile automatically tries multiple mirrors
- **Manual fix**: Use force_rebuild=true to retry with fresh base image

#### Multi-platform Build Fails
- **Cause**: ARM64 build resource constraints or timeouts
- **Solution**: Retry workflow automatically falls back to AMD64-only
- **Manual fix**: Build single platform and publish separately

#### Docker Hub API Returns No Results
- **Cause**: API rate limiting or temporary service issues
- **Solution**: Verification workflow uses manifest inspection as fallback
- **Manual fix**: Wait and re-run verification or check Docker Hub web interface

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check if image exists locally
docker manifest inspect docdyhr/mcp-wordpress:2.2.0

# Check Docker Hub API directly
curl -s https://hub.docker.com/v2/repositories/docdyhr/mcp-wordpress/tags | jq '.results[].name'

# Verify specific tag on Docker Hub
docker pull docdyhr/mcp-wordpress:2.2.0
```

## Conclusion

These improvements provide multiple layers of protection against Docker publishing failures:

1. **Prevention**: Robust Dockerfile that handles network issues gracefully
2. **Recovery**: Automatic retry logic in release workflows
3. **Verification**: Enhanced checking with multiple fallback methods
4. **Resolution**: Manual tools for immediate issue resolution

The implemented solutions address both the immediate v2.2.0 issue and establish patterns to prevent similar failures in the future.
