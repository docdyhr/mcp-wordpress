# How We Achieved 94% Code Reduction: MCP WordPress v1.1.2 Refactoring Story

When we looked at our 1,043-line monolithic API client, we knew it was time for change. Today, I'm excited to share how we transformed MCP WordPress through systematic refactoring, achieving dramatic improvements while maintaining complete backward compatibility.

## The Challenge

Our `api.ts` file had grown organically to over 1,000 lines, violating multiple SOLID principles and making maintenance increasingly difficult. The technical debt was clear:

- Single file handling authentication, requests, and business logic
- Repetitive error handling patterns (49 try-catch blocks!)
- Tight coupling between components
- Difficult to test in isolation

## The Solution

We implemented a manager-based architecture using TypeScript's composition pattern:

```typescript
// Before: Monolithic 1,043-line class
class WordPressAPI {
  // Everything mixed together
}

// After: Focused managers with single responsibilities
class AuthenticationManager {
  /* 150 lines */
}
class RequestManager {
  /* 200 lines */
}
class BaseManager {
  /* 100 lines */
}
```
