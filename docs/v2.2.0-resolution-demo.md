# Demonstration: Resolving v2.2.0 Docker Publishing Issue

This document demonstrates how to resolve the v2.2.0 Docker publishing issue using the improved tooling.

## Current Situation
- ‚úÖ NPM: v2.2.0 published successfully
- ‚ùå Docker Hub: v2.2.0 missing from registry
- üéØ Goal: Publish missing Docker image for v2.2.0

## Resolution Options

### Option 1: Automated Retry Workflow (Recommended)
```bash
# Trigger the new retry workflow
gh workflow run docker-publish-retry.yml \
  -f version="2.2.0" \
  -f force_rebuild=false
```

**What it does:**
1. Checks if v2.2.0 tag exists in git ‚úÖ
2. Verifies if Docker image already exists (it doesn't) ‚ùå
3. Builds Docker image with enhanced Dockerfile:
   - Tries multiple Alpine mirrors automatically
   - Uses timeout protection
   - Graceful fallback if mirrors fail
4. Attempts multi-platform build (linux/amd64,linux/arm64)
5. If that fails, retries with single platform
6. If that fails, retries with AMD64-only
7. Pushes to Docker Hub with tags: `2.2.0` and `v2.2.0`
8. Updates Docker Hub description
9. Verifies successful publication

### Option 2: Manual Script (For Immediate Resolution)
```bash
# Run the manual publishing script
./scripts/manual-docker-publish.sh
```

**Interactive process:**
1. Script validates environment and git state
2. Checks out v2.2.0 tag
3. Builds Docker image locally with enhanced robustness
4. Prompts for confirmation before pushing
5. Pushes to Docker Hub
6. Returns to original git state
7. Provides verification links

### Option 3: GitHub Web Interface
1. Go to: https://github.com/docdyhr/mcp-wordpress/actions/workflows/docker-publish-retry.yml
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Enter version: `2.2.0`
4. Leave "Force rebuild" unchecked
5. Click "Run workflow"

## Expected Results

After successful execution:
- ‚úÖ Docker image available: `docdyhr/mcp-wordpress:2.2.0`
- ‚úÖ Docker image available: `docdyhr/mcp-wordpress:v2.2.0`
- ‚úÖ Verification link: https://hub.docker.com/r/docdyhr/mcp-wordpress/tags?name=2.2.0

## Verification

### Verify Docker Image Exists
```bash
# Pull the image to verify it exists
docker pull docdyhr/mcp-wordpress:2.2.0

# Inspect the image
docker inspect docdyhr/mcp-wordpress:2.2.0

# Check image metadata
docker manifest inspect docdyhr/mcp-wordpress:2.2.0
```

### Verify on Docker Hub
Visit: https://hub.docker.com/r/docdyhr/mcp-wordpress/tags?name=2.2.0

Should show:
- Tag: `2.2.0`
- Tag: `v2.2.0`
- Size information
- Last updated timestamp
- Platform support (linux/amd64 minimum, linux/arm64 if multi-platform succeeded)

## Prevention for Future Releases

The enhanced workflows now include:

### Automatic Protection
1. **Enhanced Dockerfile**: Multiple Alpine mirrors with fallback
2. **Retry Logic**: Release workflow automatically retries failed Docker builds
3. **Extended Verification**: 3-minute propagation wait + multiple verification methods
4. **Auto-Retry**: Verification failure automatically triggers retry workflow

### Manual Tools
1. **Retry Workflow**: Available for any version via GitHub Actions
2. **Manual Script**: Local building and publishing with safety checks
3. **Force Rebuild**: Option to rebuild existing versions if needed

### Monitoring
1. **GitHub Issues**: Automatic issue creation for publishing failures
2. **Detailed Logs**: Enhanced debugging information in all workflows
3. **Success Notifications**: Confirmation when publishing succeeds

## Immediate Next Steps

To resolve the v2.2.0 issue immediately:

1. **Quickest**: Use GitHub web interface to trigger retry workflow
2. **Most Control**: Run manual script locally if you have Docker Hub credentials
3. **Automated**: Let the verification workflow detect and auto-retry

All methods use the enhanced Dockerfile that addresses the root cause (Alpine repository connectivity issues) that caused the original v2.2.0 publishing failure.

*This solution ensures v2.2.0 is properly published while establishing robust processes to prevent similar issues in future releases.*
