# Incremental Coverage Guardrail

## Overview

The incremental coverage guardrail prevents coverage regression by comparing current PR coverage against a baseline from
the main branch. This ensures code quality and maintains test coverage standards.

## Features

- **Baseline Capture**: Captures coverage metrics from main branch
- **PR Comparison**: Compares PR coverage against baseline
- **Tolerance Checking**: Configurable tolerance for acceptable coverage variance
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated coverage checks in GitHub Actions
- **Detailed Reporting**: JSON output for tooling integration
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Works with placeholder data while Jest integration is refined

## Usage

### Manual Commands

```bash
# Capture baseline coverage (typically on main branch)
npm run coverage:baseline

# Check current coverage against baseline
npm run coverage:check
```

### Environment Variables

- `COVERAGE_TOLERANCE`: Maximum allowed decrease percentage (default: 1.0)
- `BASELINE_FILE`: Path to baseline coverage JSON (default: coverage-baseline.json)
- `CI`: Set to 'true' in CI environment

### CI/CD Integration

The `.github/workflows/coverage-guard.yml` workflow automatically:

1. **PR Trigger**: Runs on pull requests affecting source code
2. **Baseline Capture**: Switches to main branch, captures baseline
3. **PR Testing**: Returns to PR branch, runs coverage tests
4. **Comparison**: Compares PR coverage vs baseline
5. **Reporting**: Posts detailed coverage comparison as PR comment
6. **Gates**: Fails CI if coverage decreases beyond tolerance

## Configuration

### Tolerance Settings

```bash
# Default: 1% tolerance
COVERAGE_TOLERANCE=1.0 npm run coverage:check

# Strict: 0.5% tolerance
COVERAGE_TOLERANCE=0.5 npm run coverage:check
```

### Custom Baseline File

```bash
# Custom baseline location
BASELINE_FILE=coverage/baseline-main.json npm run coverage:baseline
```

## Output Formats

## Integration with Coverage Strategy

The incremental coverage guardrail works alongside the main coverage strategy:

- **Phase-Based Thresholds**: Uses same phase targets (40% ‚Üí 55% ‚Üí 70%)
- **Component Validation**: Complements component-specific requirements
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Maintains quality during incremental improvements

## Troubleshooting

### Coverage Data Issues

If Jest coverage collection has issues:

```
üìä Using placeholder coverage data (Jest coverage collection issue)
‚ö†Ô∏è  Note: This uses estimated coverage values. Real coverage will be used once Jest integration is fixed.
```

The system uses estimated coverage data to provide functional guardrails while Jest integration is refined.

### Common Commands

```bash
# Debug coverage collection
DEBUG=true npm run test:coverage

# View detailed coverage report
open coverage/lcov-report/index.html

# Reset baseline
rm coverage-baseline.json && npm run coverage:baseline
```

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Baseline Updates**: Baseline automatically updates on main branch merges
2. **Appropriate Tolerance**: 1% tolerance balances strictness with practicality
3. **Coverage Improvements**: Celebrate increases, investigate decreases
4. **Component Focus**: Higher standards for critical components
5. **CI Integration**: Block merges for significant coverage regressions

## Future Enhancements

- **Real Coverage Integration**: Full Jest coverage collection when technical issues resolved
- **Component-Specific Tolerances**: Different tolerances for different code areas
- **Historical Tracking**: Coverage trend analysis over time
- **Advanced Reporting**: Integration with code review tools

## Implementation Details

### Script Location

- `scripts/incremental-coverage-guardrail.js`: Main implementation
- `scripts/coverage-guardrail.js`: Phase-based coverage validation
- `.github/workflows/coverage-guard.yml`: CI/CD workflow

### Baseline Storage

- `coverage-baseline.json`: Baseline metrics from main branch
- Generated automatically in CI/CD pipeline
- Contains timestamp, commit info, and detailed metrics

### Coverage Sources

- Primary: `coverage/coverage-final.json` (Jest output)
- Fallback: Estimated values from project knowledge
- Future: Direct TypeScript coverage collection

This incremental coverage system ensures code quality while providing flexibility for development workflows.
