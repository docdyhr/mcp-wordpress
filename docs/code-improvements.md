# Code Improvements TODO

## Test Coverage Improvements Needed

Based on coverage analysis, the following areas need attention:

### Critical Areas (0% coverage)

1. **Tool Implementations** (`src/tools/`):

   - site.ts (0% coverage)
   - taxonomies.ts (0% coverage)
   - users.ts (0% coverage)
   - media.ts (0.78% coverage)
   - posts.ts (0.58% coverage)

2. **Utility Functions** (`src/utils/`):
   - enhancedError.ts (0% coverage)
   - error.ts (0% coverage)
   - streaming.ts (0% coverage)
   - toolWrapper.ts (3.12% coverage)
   - validation.ts (2.56% coverage)

### Recommendations

1. Add unit tests for all tool implementations
2. Create test cases for error handling utilities
3. Test streaming functionality with mock data
4. Improve validation test coverage

## Performance Optimizations

1. Consider lazy loading for tool implementations
2. Implement connection pooling for multi-site setups
3. Add request batching for bulk operations

## Documentation Improvements

1. Add API documentation for each tool
2. Create troubleshooting guide
3. Add performance tuning guide
