## Technical Debt Cleanup Summary

### Diagnostic Results

- ✅ No critical errors found in project
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ ESLint passing with no errors
- ✅ All security tests passing (40/40)
- ⚠️ Only expected .env warnings (template variables)

### Repository Cleanup Completed

1. **Removed obsolete documentation** (4 files):
   - PRD.md (completed product requirements)
   - DOCKER_V6_MIGRATION.md (completed migration)
   - PERFORMANCE_AUDIT_REPORT.md (outdated audit)
   - SECURITY_TEST_REPORT.md (outdated report)

2. **Deleted private/temporary files** (3 files):
   - private-configs.txt
   - private-docu-impro.md
   - security-fixes.txt (npm install log)

3. **Consolidated duplicate configs** (5 files):
   - claude-desktop-config-docker.json
   - claude-desktop-config-multi-site.json
   - claude-desktop-config-npm.json
   - claude-desktop-config-single-site.json
   - claude-desktop-docker-multisite-corrected.json
   → Consolidated into docs/examples/claude-desktop-config.md

4. **Removed test scripts** (2 files):
   - test-claude-configs.sh (hardcoded paths)
   - test-vscode.sh (redundant wrapper)

### Documentation Improvements

- Created docs/examples/ directory for configuration examples
- Added docs/testing-configurations.md explaining Jest configs
- Added docs/code-improvements.md tracking test coverage gaps

### Code Quality

- Fixed overly strict tool description validation test
- Improved repository organization following maintenance guidelines
- Reduced clutter while maintaining functionality

### Test Coverage Areas Identified

- Tool implementations need unit tests (0-3% coverage)
- Utility functions need better coverage
- Streaming and error handling utilities untested

### Next Steps

1. Improve test coverage for tools and utilities
2. Consider consolidating Jest configurations
3. Add unit tests for critical uncovered code paths
4. Continue following repository maintenance guidelines
