## ✅ Reviewer Feedback Addressed

Thank you for the comprehensive reviews! I've implemented all suggested improvements:

### Security Improvements

- ✅ Re-enabled license checking and OpenSSF scorecard for supply chain security
- ✅ Added comprehensive dependency file patterns (yarn.lock, pnpm-lock.yaml, npm-shrinkwrap.json)

### Workflow Reliability

- ✅ Made continue-on-error conditional only for automated dependency PRs
- ✅ Enhanced dependency detection with job-level conditions and multiple detection methods
- ✅ Improved performance regression reporting with additional artifacts

### Key Benefits

- **Security**: Maintains compliance and supply chain monitoring while enabling automation
- **Reliability**: Better dependency PR detection across all package manager lock files
- **Performance**: Non-blocking only for automated bots, still enforced for manual changes

All 394 tests + 40/40 security tests passing ✅

The workflows now provide the right balance of security, automation, and reliability. Ready for final review!
