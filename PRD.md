# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Enhanced Validation, Testing & Production Readiness

### Overview

This PRD outlines the requirements for advancing the MCP WordPress project's validation, testing, 
and production capabilities to enterprise-grade standards.

### Background

The MCP WordPress project has achieved production readiness with comprehensive security validation, 
performance monitoring, and Docker containerization. This enhancement focuses on three critical areas
identified through project analysis:

1. **Enhanced Validation** - Moving from manual to schema-based validation
2. **Advanced Test Coverage** - Implementing property-based and contract testing
3. **Production Validation** - Adding automated rollback and regression detection

### Goals & Success Metrics

#### Primary Goals

- **Reduce configuration errors** by 95% through schema validation
- **Increase test coverage** of edge cases by 80% via property-based testing
- **Minimize production incidents** through automated rollback (target: <2min recovery)
- **Prevent API regressions** via contract testing

#### Success Metrics

- Configuration validation: 100% schema coverage
- Property-based testing: 80% of critical tool paths covered
- Contract testing: Full WordPress REST API coverage
- Performance gates: <5% regression tolerance
- Production rollback time: <2 minutes

### Requirements

- Rollback execution: <2min end-to-end

#### Reliability

- 99.9% uptime during deployments
- Zero data loss during rollbacks
- Consistent test results across environments

#### Security

- Schema validation prevents injection attacks
- Secure credential handling in all validation
- No sensitive data in test artifacts

#### Maintainability

- Clear documentation for all new testing patterns
- Automated test generation where possible
- Backward compatibility with existing tests

### Implementation Timeline

**Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2)**: Enhanced Validation

- Configuration schema validation
- Enhanced cross-reference validation

**Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4)**: Advanced Testing

- Property-based testing implementation
- Contract testing setup
- Performance regression gates

**Phase 3 (Weeks 5-6)**: Production Validation

- Automated rollback mechanisms
- Blue-green deployment
- Advanced cache testing

### Dependencies

#### External Dependencies

- `fast-check` - Property-based testing
- `@pact-foundation/pact` - Contract testing
- `zod` - Schema validation (already installed)

#### Internal Dependencies

- Existing performance monitoring system
- Current Docker containerization
- CI/CD pipeline infrastructure

### Risks & Mitigation

#### Technical Risks

- **Risk**: Property-based tests may be slow
- **Mitigation**: Implement test categorization and parallel execution
