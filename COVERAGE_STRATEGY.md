## Coverage Thresholds and Enforcement

### Jest Configuration Thresholds

#### Phase 1 Thresholds (Immediate)
```javascript
coverageThreshold: {
  global: {
    branches: 30,
    functions: 35, 
    lines: 40,
    statements: 38
  }
}
```

#### Component-Specific Thresholds
```javascript
coverageThreshold: {
  // Critical components - higher standards
  'src/utils/validation.ts': {
    branches: 80, functions: 90, lines: 85, statements: 85
  },
  'src/utils/error.ts': {
    branches: 100, functions: 100, lines: 100, statements: 100
  },
  
  // Core business logic - medium standards
  'src/client/api.ts': {
    branches: 50, functions: 60, lines: 55, statements: 55
  },
  'src/tools/': {
    branches: 40, functions: 50, lines: 45, statements: 45
  },
  
  // Advanced features - baseline standards
  'src/performance/': {
    branches: 30, functions: 40, lines: 35, statements: 35
  }
}
```

### Enforcement Strategy

#### Pre-commit Hooks
- Run coverage check before commits
- Block commits that reduce coverage below thresholds
- Allow temporary threshold bypasses with `--skip-coverage` flag for urgent fixes

#### CI/CD Integration
- Generate coverage reports on every PR
- Post coverage diff comments on PRs  
- Block merges that significantly reduce coverage (>2% regression)
- Publish coverage badges automatically

#### Coverage Guardrails
- Existing `scripts/coverage-guardrail.js` enhanced with:
  - Component-specific threshold validation
  - Trend analysis and regression detection
  - Actionable recommendations for improvement

## Testing Infrastructure Improvements

### Enhanced Jest Configuration

#### Coverage Collection
```javascript
collectCoverageFrom: [
  'src/**/*.ts',
  '!src/**/*.d.ts',
  '!src/**/__mocks__/**',
  '!src/**/*.test.ts'
],
coverageReporters: [
  'text-summary',  // Console output
  'lcov',          // For external tools
  'html',          // Human-readable reports  
  'json',          // Machine-readable data
  'cobertura'      // CI/CD integration
]
```

#### Coverage Exclusions (Justified)
```javascript
coveragePathIgnorePatterns: [
  '/node_modules/',
  '/dist/',
  '/tests/',
  '/docs/',
  'src/types/',           // Type definitions only
  'src/.*\\.d\\.ts$',     // TypeScript declaration files
  'src/.*/index.ts$'      // Re-export files only
]
```
