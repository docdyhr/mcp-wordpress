The Docker images have been manually published and are now available on Docker Hub.

**Resolution:**
- Fixed the husky pre-push hook interference in the semantic-release workflow by adding \`HUSKY: 0\` environment variable
- Removed invalid \`record: true\` parameter from Docker build action
- Manually triggered Docker builds for all affected versions

**Verification:**
- Docker images are now available at: https://hub.docker.com/r/docdyhr/mcp-wordpress/tags
- Future releases should publish automatically without this issue

This issue is now closed."
