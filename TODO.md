# TODO - MCP WordPress Development Tasks

## High Priority (Current Sprint)

### Code Quality & Architecture

- [x] **Split large API client class** - Refactor `WordPressClient` (1043 lines) into smaller focused classes:
  - [x] `AuthenticationManager` for auth handling
  - [x] `RequestManager` for HTTP operations
  - [x] `BaseManager` for common functionality
  - [ ] `MediaManager` for file operations (planned)
  - [ ] `ContentManager` for posts/pages (planned)
  - [ ] `UserManager` for user operations (planned)
- [x] **Implement dependency injection** - Reduce tight coupling between server and client
- [ ] **Add response caching** - Implement intelligent caching for read operations
- [x] **Optimize error handling** - Pre-allocate common error instances

### Testing & Quality Assurance

- [ ] **Expand test coverage** - Target 80%+ coverage (currently ~25%)
  - [ ] Authentication method tests
  - [ ] Multi-site configuration tests
  - [ ] Error handling edge cases
  - [ ] Rate limiting scenarios
- [ ] **Add integration tests** - Real WordPress API interaction tests
- [ ] **Performance testing** - Load testing with multiple sites
- [ ] **Security testing** - Input validation and injection prevention

### Documentation Consolidation

- [ ] **Merge duplicate documentation** - Consolidate 9 markdown files into 3-4 focused docs
- [ ] **API documentation** - Auto-generate from TypeScript definitions
- [ ] **Tool usage examples** - Comprehensive examples for all 54 tools
- [ ] **Troubleshooting guide** - Common issues and solutions

## Medium Priority (Next Sprint)

### Performance Optimization

- [ ] **HTTP connection pooling** - Implement keep-alive connections
- [ ] **Request batching** - Batch multiple API calls where possible
- [ ] **Memory optimization** - Reduce object allocation in hot paths
- [ ] **Bundle size analysis** - Remove unused exports and dependencies

### Security Enhancements

- [ ] **Input sanitization** - Add validation layer for all user inputs
- [ ] **Credential encryption** - Encrypt stored credentials
- [ ] **Rate limiting** - Implement client-side rate limiting
- [ ] **Security audit** - Third-party security review

### Feature Enhancements

- [ ] **Plugin management tools** - Install, activate, deactivate plugins
- [ ] **Theme management tools** - Switch and customize themes
- [ ] **Backup/restore tools** - Site backup and restoration
- [ ] **SEO optimization tools** - Meta tags, sitemaps, analytics

### Developer Experience

- [ ] **CLI tool improvements** - Better setup wizard and diagnostics
- [ ] **VS Code extension** - IntelliSense for WordPress tools
- [ ] **Debug mode enhancements** - Better logging and error reporting
- [ ] **Hot reload support** - Development mode with auto-restart

## Low Priority (Future Sprints)

### Advanced Features

- [ ] **Multi-language support** - WordPress multilingual sites
- [ ] **Custom post types** - Support for custom content types
- [ ] **Advanced queries** - Complex WordPress queries and filters
- [ ] **Webhook integration** - Real-time WordPress event handling

### Monitoring & Analytics

- [ ] **Performance metrics** - Track API response times and success rates
- [ ] **Usage analytics** - Tool usage patterns and optimization
- [ ] **Health monitoring** - Automated health checks and alerts
- [ ] **Error tracking** - Centralized error logging and analysis

### Infrastructure

- [ ] **Docker support** - Containerized deployment
- [ ] **Cloud deployment** - AWS/GCP/Azure deployment guides
- [ ] **Load balancing** - Multi-instance deployment support
- [ ] **Database optimization** - Query optimization and caching

### Community & Ecosystem

- [ ] **Plugin ecosystem** - Third-party tool development framework
- [ ] **Community templates** - Shared configuration templates
- [ ] **Integration examples** - Examples with popular WordPress plugins
- [ ] **Migration tools** - Tools for migrating from other CMSs

## Technical Debt Tracking

### High Impact Issues

- [x] **Large API client class** (1043 lines) - Violates SRP, hard to maintain
- [x] **Repetitive error handling** - Duplicated try-catch blocks across tools
- [x] **Missing abstractions** - Direct WordPress API coupling
- **Configuration complexity** - Mixed environment/file configuration

### Medium Impact Issues

- [x] **Unused dependencies** - Security and feature gaps (removed unused imports)
- [x] **Missing ESLint config** - Code quality not enforced
- **Documentation sprawl** - Information scattered across 9 files
- **No response caching** - Performance optimization opportunity

### Low Impact Issues

- **Unused exports** - Bundle size optimization
- **Compatibility re-exports** - Remove or document purpose
- **Minor performance** - Error object allocation optimization
