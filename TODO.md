**Status**: v2.7.0 PRODUCTION STABLE ✅  
**Updated**: 2025-01-15  
**Architecture**: COMPOSITION-BASED 🏗️  
**Testing**: 635 test files, 54.23%+ coverage ✅  
**CI/CD**: OPTIMIZED PIPELINE DEPLOYED 🚀  

## 🎯 Current Status

### ✅ **ALL CRITICAL DEBT RESOLVED**

The project has successfully completed its technical debt remediation phase. All P0 (Critical) and P1 (High Priority) items have been resolved, resulting in a production-ready codebase with modern architecture patterns.

**Key Achievements:**
- ✅ Module resolution and test infrastructure stabilized (635/635 test files)
- ✅ Composition-based architecture implemented (eliminated inheritance coupling)
- ✅ TypeScript path aliases and barrel exports throughout
- ✅ Complete JWT authentication with token refresh
- ✅ Async file operations (eliminated event loop blocking)
- ✅ Comprehensive logger integration (LoggerFactory adoption)
- ✅ Updated dependencies (Node.js 24, Zod 4, security patches)

## 📅 Review Schedule

- **Weekly**: Monitor health checks and performance metrics
- **Monthly**: Dependency updates and security scans
- **Quarterly**: Architecture review and backlog prioritization

## 🔄 Accepted Technical Debt

**Legacy Security Modules**: Accepted pending full security audit (Review: Q2 2025)
- Reason: Stable and adequately secured
- Mitigation: Enhanced monitoring, regular scans
