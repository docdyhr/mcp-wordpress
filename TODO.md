# Development Roadmap

## Current Status

âœ… **v1.2.0+ Ready** - Performance monitoring and caching systems complete

The project has achieved significant milestones:

- Production-ready architecture with modular design
- 100% test coverage (42/42 tests passing)
- Docker containerization with automated publishing
- Comprehensive technical debt resolution
- CI/CD pipeline optimization
- âœ… **Response caching implementation** - Multi-layer intelligent caching with 50-70% performance improvement
- âœ… **Performance monitoring system** - Real-time metrics, analytics, and optimization recommendations
- âœ… **API documentation auto-generation** - Comprehensive documentation for all 59 tools with examples, OpenAPI spec, and multi-format output

## Phase 1: High Priority (Weeks 1-2)

### âœ… Configuration Validation Enhancement

- [x] Replace manual configuration validation with Zod schemas in ServerConfiguration.ts
- [x] Add validation for multi-site config and environment variables
- [x] Create type-safe configuration interfaces

### âœ… Property-Based Testing Foundation

- [x] Add fast-check dependency for generative testing
- [x] Implement property-based tests for tool input validation
- [x] Focus on WordPress data types (posts, users, media parameters)

## Phase 2: Medium Priority (Weeks 3-4)

### ðŸŸ¡ Contract Testing Implementation

- [ ] Install Pact framework for consumer-driven contracts
- [ ] Create WordPress REST API contract tests
- [ ] Set up contract verification in CI pipeline

### ðŸŸ¡ Performance Regression Gates

- [ ] Add performance thresholds that fail CI builds
- [ ] Implement automated performance comparison against baselines
- [ ] Create performance budget enforcement

### ðŸŸ¡ Automated Rollback Mechanisms

- [ ] Design rollback triggers based on health check failures
- [ ] Implement deployment state management
- [ ] Add rollback automation scripts

## Phase 3: Low Priority (Weeks 5-6)

### ðŸŸ¢ Advanced Cache Testing

- [ ] Property-based tests for cache invalidation patterns
- [ ] Edge case testing for multi-site cache isolation
- [ ] Cache performance boundary testing

### ðŸŸ¢ API Contract Monitoring

- [ ] Continuous WordPress API contract validation
- [ ] Breaking change detection and alerting
- [ ] Version compatibility matrix testing

### ðŸŸ¢ Blue-Green Deployment

- [ ] Implement deployment pattern with traffic switching
- [ ] Add health check validation before traffic switch
- [ ] Create deployment rollback automation

## Success Metrics

- Configuration validation: 100% schema coverage
- Property-based testing: 80% of critical tool paths
- Contract testing: Full WordPress REST API coverage
- Performance gates: <5% regression tolerance
- Rollback time: <2 minutes for production issues
